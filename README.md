A simple python code that acts as a classic dice rolling simulator. I have used randon module here to randomize simulator for random outputs.
Also I have imported time module to prompt the user to wait for some time, while dice is rolling.
If user got 6, Automatically dice is rolled again.
then the code asks user that wannna roll the dice again or not. If yes, dice is rolled again. If not code is terminated.
